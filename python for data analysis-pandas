Application of python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Web Scraping-you can extract content from particular webpage.
2.You can perfrom Web development
3.You can perform testing.
4.You can perfrom Data Analysis.





Data Life Cycle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Data is stored in different formats (we can have csv file,excel file,or html file) now what we do we convert that data or transform that data into a single format and store it somewhere(that's where data warehousing comes into picture).
2.Onces we have stored some data we can perform certain analysis on it.(we can perform predictive modeling,we can join merge data).
3.Now onces we have done the analysis we can even plot it in the form of graph and that stage is known as Data visualization.





Data Analysis using Python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Pandas is a software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation nad analysis.
2.Matplotlib is basically a data visualization module that we use in python.
3.Numpy is actually a fundamental package forscientific computing in python.It contains a powerful n dimensional array object.It has tools for integrating with C,C++.It is very useful in performing linear algebra of fourier transform random number capabilities etc.
4.Scipy is a open source python module used for scientific computing and technical computing.It contain module for optimization andlinear algebra,integrationiterpolationspecial function,fourier transforms.





Pandas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Pandas is an open source data analysis library written in python.
2.It leverages the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientists.
3.It provides rich and highly robust data operations.





Pandas Data Structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Pandas has two types of data structure-
    a.series-
        It's a one-dimensional array with indexes,it stores a single column or row of data in a DatFrame.
    b.DataFrame-
        It's a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contains one or multiple columns.
2.A one-dimensional array(labeled) capable of holding any type of data-series.
3.A two-dimensional data(labeled) structure with columns of potentially different types of data-DataFrame.





Pandas Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Slicing the Dataframe-you can slice the dataframe if you want only a particular part.
2.Changing the index-you can change the index value.
3.Data Conversion-you can convert the data into a different format.
4.Changing the column headers-you can change the column header.
5.Concatenation-you can perform concatenation of multiple dataframe.
6.Joining and merging-you can perform joining or merging of two or more data frames.
